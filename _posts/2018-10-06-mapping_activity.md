You should already have a [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) account. If you've gotten this far without creating one, we've got bigger problems.

Caroline Kee covered a pretty straightforward, if disturbing, CDC report on [rising suicide rates nationwide](https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolinekee/suicide-rates-increase-us-2016-all-states). The map she included came directly from the CDC. It isn't a terrible map, but there are a few ways it could be much better. Can you tell at a glance **which states stand out** as having the most severe increase?

Take a look at the legend. The sizes on those buckets are wild. The darkest has a 20 percentage pt spread, and the next has just a six percentage pt spread. These are quantiles: the CDC designed the buckets so that each would have 12 states in it. And then they chipped off Nevada which is the only state that saw a decrease.

Luckily, BuzzFeed News actually links to the original report -- the raw data is available in the CDC's [original report](https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/suicide/infographic.html#graphic1) which appeared in the [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html). To avoid hiccups in the copy and paste process, I went ahead and pulled the numbers for you.

Workbench is still a work in progress but one thing it does well is show the transformations I applied to the original data.

**Step 0:** Download the csv from Workbench.

**Step 1:** Log into Datawrapper and choose "Create a map". We want a choropleth.

**Step 2:** (Datawrapper thinks of this as Step 1), search for "USA States" under "What type of map do you want to create?".

**Step 3:** Import your dataset. But get in the habit of reading pop up windows. Do we have ISO-Codes or Names here?

Once you've uploaded your data, read through the next screen, too.

**Title:** What is the takeaway? In the story, they captioned this "Suicide rates increased in almost all states between 1999 and 2016 â€” some by more than 30%.", but the chart uses "Figure. Percent change in annual suicide rate,* by state-- United States , from 1999/2001 to 2014/2016"

**Caption:** Tell me more about what I'm looking at. "A recent CDC report found that there is just one state in the union -- Nevada -- where suicides did not rise between 1999 and 2016."

**Map:** What are those buckets? If you look at this map where would you say the problem is most dramatic? This is a quantile map: they chose the buckets so that there are roughly the same number of states in each bucket. But one of these ranges is not like the others: 38-58% is a far bigger range. If we use "equal intervals," we wind up with very different buckets:

-1- 10.72
10.72 - 22.44
22.44 - 34.16
34.16 - 45.88
45.88 - 57.60

I think it makes some kind of sense to break it at zero, and at the national average (25.4)


## Unsolved Homicides


The Washington Post collected data on more than 52,000 criminal homicides over the past decade in 50 of the largest American cities.
