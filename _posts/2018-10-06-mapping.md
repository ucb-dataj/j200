# Why Map?

We use maps to understand the data, to find a story, to tell a story. Some of my favorite examples:

* Students at University of Kingâ€™s College School of Journalism in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada took on a pretty straightforward public records project. For their 2017 project, [Something in the water](https://signalhfx.ca/deadly-water/) they pulled a map, provided by the Nova Scotia Department of Environment, of every well that was drilled or dug in the province between 1920 and 2014l -- 96,000 in tota. They compared that map with a second map, also provided by the Department of the Environment, that showed areas of known or likely groundwater arsenic contamination. In their case they found that about 70,000 wells in Nova Scotia were "very likely" to have arsenic. That was a story all by itself, but even with much less overlap, that gives you a great list of people to start reaching out to. Even without a published map, they've got a great story.

*  There are about 40 high rise buildings in San Francisco that are [exceptionally succeptible to earthquakes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/us/california-earthquakes-high-rises.html). The NY Times found a list of those buildings in the appendix to a [USGS report](https://www.usgs.gov/news/usgs-rolls-out-groundbreaking-earthquake-study-haywired-earthquake-scenario?qt-news_science_products=1#qt-news_science_products).

## Making better maps

## Shapes, Points,  and Lines

### Mapping Points
"Geocoding" refers to the process of identifying an individual latitude/longitude pair for an address or other location description. To actually plot a location on a map, you need the location's latitude and longitude. `219 West 40th Street` means nothing without coordinates.

Geocoding is often challenging because there aren't great free resources for doing batch jobs -- processing many addresses at once. The [Geocoding Tip Sheet](https://github.com/amandabee/cunyjdata/wiki/Tip-Sheet:-Geocoding) is a round up of good options, but often public data sources already include coordinates.

### Mapping Lines
We use lines pretty rarely in intro maps, but a line is  a series of two or more points connected together.

### Mapping Polygons
Zipcodes, council districts, police precincts -- these are all polygons. Most of your maps will be in polygons. These polygons are defined in (usually) one of two specialized file formats -- a "Shapefile" or a "KML" file. The syntax of the file types varies, but they contain basically the same information -- the polygon called "Bronx CB 04" is defined by this series of lat/lon pairs.

Often (usually) your data won't include a shapefile. If you have high school graduation rates by school district, and you want to map those, you need to find a shapefile that describes the outline of each school district, and then you need to combine that shapefile with your data, by identifying a column that the two tables have in common.

The [Shapefiles Tip Sheet](https://github.com/amandabee/cunyjdata/wiki/Where-to-Find-Shapefiles) has some excellent resources for finding shapefiles.

## Other good software options

* We use QGIS in the data investigations class because it is much more powerful. The learning curve is a bit steeper, however, and it doesn't produce great interactive maps (though it will output a vector graphic you can edit in Illustrator, for gorgeous static maps.)
* For years, I taught students how to use [Carto](https://carto.com/) because it is easy to master and flexible. Unfortunately, they no longer offer a free tier to anyone but students, which means that if you're just publishing your first one or two maps, you have to commit to a paid account. They don't even publish the pricing for those accounts. Sad trombone.
* Datawrapper will generate maps, but the interface is a bit hard to use for anything complex.
* Tableau generates good maps. Peter Aldhous has a nice [Tableau walkthrough](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/intro-data/week4.html) from 2016
