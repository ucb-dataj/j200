# Why Map?

We use maps to understand the data, to find a story, to tell a story. Some of my favorite examples include:


# Making a map

## Other good options

* We use QGIS in the data investigations class because it is much more powerful. The learning curve is a bit steeper, however, and it doesn't produce great interactive maps (though it will output a vector graphic you can edit in Illustrator, for gorgeous static maps.)
* For years, I taught students how to use [Carto](https://carto.com/) because it is easy to master and flexible. Unfortunately, they no longer offer a free tier to anyone but students, which means that if you're just publishing your first one or two maps, you have to commit to a paid account. They don't even publish the pricing for those accounts. Sad trombone.
* Datawrapper will generate maps, but the interface is a bit hard to use for anything complex.
