I can't say enough about the importance of learning how to ask for help. If you look at my [gis.stackexchange.com](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/24497/amanda?tab=questions&sort=newest) profile you can see where I got stuck and then unstuck, starting back in 2013. There's a community there that is very good about [thoroughly explaining](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/84443/what-is-this-postgis-query-doing-to-show-great-circle-connections) what you're dealing with.
