## Examples of relatively simple maps:

## And Maps to Remake

This was an interesting [quick hit on the rise of suicide](https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolinekee/suicide-rates-increase-us-2016-all-states) nationwide, but they used a map provided by the CDC, but really missed an opportunity to frame it. 

**Title:** What is the takeaway? In the story, they captioned this "Suicide rates increased in almost all states between 1999 and 2016 â€” some by more than 30%.", but the chart uses "Figure. Percent change in annual suicide rate,* by state-- United States , from 1999/2001 to 2014/2016"

**Caption:** Tell me more about what I'm looking at. "A recent CDC report found that there is just one state in the union -- Nevada -- where suicides did not rise between 1999 and 2016." 

**Map:** What are those buckets? 

More thoughts: how many of you did not recognize this as a map of the United States?
