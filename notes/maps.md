## Examples of relatively simple maps:

Cal Matters mapped [housing initiatives on the June ballot](https://calmatters.org/articles/map-how-we-voted-on-housing-issues-up-and-down-the-state/) -- Let's talk about how to make it more skimmable? Does this work and convey information, as a map? 


## A Map to Remake

This was an interesting [quick hit on the rise of suicide](https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolinekee/suicide-rates-increase-us-2016-all-states) nationwide, but they used a map provided by the CDC, but really missed an opportunity to frame it. 

**Title:** What is the takeaway? In the story, they captioned this "Suicide rates increased in almost all states between 1999 and 2016 â€” some by more than 30%.", but the chart uses "Figure. Percent change in annual suicide rate,* by state-- United States , from 1999/2001 to 2014/2016"

**Caption:** Tell me more about what I'm looking at. "A recent CDC report found that there is just one state in the union -- Nevada -- where suicides did not rise between 1999 and 2016." 

**Map:** What are those buckets? If you look at this map where would you say the problem is most dramatic? This is a quantile map: they chose the buckets so that there are roughly the same number of states in each bucket. But one of these ranges is not like the others: 38-58% is a far bigger range. If we use "equal intervals," we wind up with very different buckets:

-1- 10.72
10.72 - 22.44
22.44 - 34.16
34.16 - 45.88
45.88 - 57.60

I think it makes some kind of sense to break it at zero, and at the national average (25.4)


The CDC report is based on raw data available in the CDC's [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html)



More thoughts: how many of you did not recognize this as a map of the United States? Some things we can leave off. "This map shows"

### Unsolved Homicides

So let's filter out the data that we don't need and zoom in on our region.
