# Basic Details

1:30 - 3:30 PM

Goals: introduce the basics of mapping and make a simple map. Students should leave with clarity about what kind of data is required for digital mapping.

## Lecture
Why we map
 - to understand geographic data
 - to tell stories with geography
Maps can be dead simple or they can be ornate.

* Students at University of Kingâ€™s College School of Journalism in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada took on a pretty straightforward public records project. For their 2017 project, [Something in the water](https://signalhfx.ca/deadly-water/) they pulled a map, provided by the Nova Scotia Department of Environment, of every well that was drilled or dug in the province between 1920 and 2014l -- 96,000 in tota. They compared that map with a second map, also provided by the Department of the Environment, that showed areas of known or likely groundwater arsenic contamination. In their case they found that about 70,000 wells in Nova Scotia were "very likely" to have arsenic. That was a story all by itself, but even with much less overlap, that gives you a great list of people to start reaching out to. Even without a published map, they've got a great story.

*  There are about 40 high rise buildings in San Francisco that are [exceptionally succeptible to earthquakes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/us/california-earthquakes-high-rises.html). The NY Times found a list of those buildings in the appendix to a [USGS report](https://www.usgs.gov/news/usgs-rolls-out-groundbreaking-earthquake-study-haywired-earthquake-scenario?qt-news_science_products=1#qt-news_science_products).
* San Francisco Public Press layered the map of un-retrofitted soft story buildings over the liquefaction map provided by the USGS to create a [very rough list of unsafe buildings](https://sfpublicpress.org/softstorylist) in San Francisco.

So they went with a table instead.-->



How to map
 - I know you've already talked about design and about thinking about how to convey information to your audience.
 - If you're mapping to understand what the data says,
 - three basic elements, points + lines + shapes.
 + + Your first project is always going to be turning the data you have into data that you can map, or at least confirming that you have geographical information. That almost always means either [geocoding your data](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-storytelling/wiki/Tip-Sheet:-Geocoding), or [finding a suitable shapefile](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-storytelling/wiki/Where-to-Find-Shapefiles).

Making maps better:
* Can you scan the [CALmatters map](https://calmatters.org/articles/map-how-we-voted-on-housing-issues-up-and-down-the-state/)? Spend a few minutes talking in a small group about what would make that map more skimmable. Sketch it out.
