# Basic Details

1:30 - 3:30 PM

Goals: introduce the basics of mapping and make a simple map. Students should leave with clarity about what kind of data is required for digital mapping.

## Lecture
Why we map
 - to understand geographic data
 - to tell stories with geography
Maps can be dead simple or they can be ornate.

How to map
 - I know you've already talked about design and about thinking about how to convey information to your audience.
 - If you're mapping to understand what the data says,
 - three basic elements, points + lines + shapes.
 + + Your first project is always going to be turning the data you have into data that you can map, or at least confirming that you have geographical information. That almost always means either [geocoding your data](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-storytelling/wiki/Tip-Sheet:-Geocoding), or [finding a suitable shapefile](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-storytelling/wiki/Where-to-Find-Shapefiles).

Making maps better:
* Can you scan the [CALmatters map](https://calmatters.org/articles/map-how-we-voted-on-housing-issues-up-and-down-the-state/)? Spend a few minutes talking in a small group about what would make that map more skimmable. Sketch it out.
