## Not Making Bad Charts
Are millenials really having fewer children? The answer is probably "duh, of course they are". But looking at stories about the data there are a lot of examples of y-axis shenanigans:

* If you look at the same data with a wider Y-axis spread, you see something that looks a lot more like a steady trend, as in an [NPR piece](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/01/14/462816458/average-age-of-first-time-moms-keeps-climbing-in-the-u-s) about the same data [or the CDC report](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db232.pdf) that precipitated the coverage.
