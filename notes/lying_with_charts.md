Are millenials really having fewer children? The answer is probably "duh, of course they are". But looking at stories about the data there are a lot of examples 

This rando cribbed his charts from Business Insider, but check out the y-axis:

If you look at the same data with a wider Y-axis spread, you see something that looks a lot more like a stead trend:

Interesting lesson: let's talk about what data would get at that, and go look at the data. We want two things: mean age at first birth, and birth rate. And we want to know whether millenials stand out or are just being consistent with long standing trends.
